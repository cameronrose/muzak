Music search engine using Spotify and Discogs (Coming soon) APIs.

This is a search engine, powered by Spotify's API, that lets you search for your favorite artist and listen to previews of their
most popular songs. I created my own custom audio player with album art.

In a future update, I will add a biography section and possibly links to that artist's website.

Made with the following - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, Spotify API, Responsive Web Design
