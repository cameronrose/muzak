# muzak
Music search engine using Spotify and Discogs APIs.

This is a search engine, powered by Spotify's API, that lets you search for your favorite artist and listen to previews of their
most popular songs. I created my own custom audio player with album art.

In a future update, I will add a biography section and possibly links to that artist's website.

** Update April 2018 - Spotify has made a change to their API that I will need to investigate and fix in Muzak. I plan to do this as soon as I can.

Made with the following - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, Spotify API, Responsive Web Design
